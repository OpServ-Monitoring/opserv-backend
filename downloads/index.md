We're currently still full-on in development mode, so no official binaries right now.
Feel free to clone our back and frontend and try the app for yourself:

[OpServ Monitoring Project](https://github.com/OpServ-Monitoring)

We also have a few pre-release builds that are automatically created on tagged commits:

[OpServ GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OpServ-Monitoring/opserv-backend/releases)

These will however not represent the current state of the project.
