In case you want to contribute to the project simply fork the project on GitHub.
You can both, fork the [frontend](https://github.com/OpServ-Monitoring/opserv-frontend), namely the web-interface, and the [backend](https://github.com/OpServ-Monitoring/opserv-backend).

In case you have problems getting the backend to run, follow this [install instructions](/contribute/installation).

After you've finished your improvement make a pull request on GitHub stating the changes you've made.
