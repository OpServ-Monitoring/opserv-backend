Welcome to official website of OpServ monitoring!

## Where to go <a name="doc-overview"></a>

This documentation is separated into three different parts 
based on the different user groups of the system.

Do you want to know how to use opserv to monitor your system? Or do you need an overview of all features the web-interface offers? Take a look at [the user guide](/docs/guide) to learn more.

In case you want to contribute to the project or are just curious about how the system is set up make yourself familiar with the [system architecure](/docs/architecure).

Dont like the included web interface? Build your own interface using one of the offered apis. 
We recommend you to get started [learning about one of the apis](/docs/apis) by reading its reference.

Also [feel free to contribute](/docs/contribute) to the project!

## The name _opserv_ <a name="naming"></a>

As [stated below](#history) opserv started out as a university project.
In need of a name to better promote the build solution we came of with opserv.
Its a combination of words, an abbreviation and a letter variation, as it's stand for:

- observe
  - A monitoring tool opserves the system it's running on.
- Ops
  - as in Operations, a term commonly used in IT for staff that e.g. maintains server which may be one of the possible user groups.
- serve
  - like a servant, opserv should help you by making system monitoring easier and will operate as you desire.
- server
  - truly, this one is somewhat cheated but opserver would've sounded lame, right? Opserv was intentionally build to run as montoring tool on servers (but surely runs on private computers aswell)
- open
  - build from ground up as an open source project, all of its code is published under the GNU GPL 3.0 and can be viewed [on Github](https://github.com/OpServ-Monitoring)
